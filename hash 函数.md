> _Floating-point numbers._ If the keys are real numbers between 0 and 1, we might just multiply by M and round off to the nearest integer to get an index between 0 and M-1. Although it is intuitive, this approach is defective because it gives more weight to the most significant bits of the keys; the least significant bits play no role. One way to address this situation is to use modular hashing on the binary representation of the key (this is what Java does).
