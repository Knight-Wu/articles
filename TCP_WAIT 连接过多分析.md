#### TCP 回顾
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protoco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protoco)
1. 关闭过程
> 重点语句

> A connection can be ["half-open"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_half-open "TCP half-open"), in which case one side has terminated its end, but the other has not. The side that has terminated can no longer send any data into the connection, but the other side can. The terminating side should continue reading the data until the other side terminates as well.
意思是从 FIN_WAIT_2 到 TIME_WAIT 状态是主动关闭方等待被动关闭方发送完所有消息

* time_wait 状态的作用
1. 确保被动关闭方B 能知道主动关闭方 A 已经完全关闭了, 否则会一直处于LAST_ACK 的状态, 认为旧有的连接没有完全关闭, 进而有可能导致新建的连接也失败.
> Without the `TIME-WAIT` state, a connection could be reopened while the remote end still thinks the previous connection is valid. When it receives a _SYN_ segment (and the sequence number matches), it will answer with a _RST_ as it is not expecting such a segment. The new connection will be aborted with an error

time_wait 会等待60秒后关闭.
> [RFC 793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793 "RFC 793: Transmission Control Protocol")  requires the  `TIME-WAIT`  state to last twice the time of the  MSL. On Linux, this duration is  **not**  tunable and is defined in  `include/net/tcp.h`  as one minute:
define TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN (60*HZ) /* how long to wait to destroy TIME-WAIT
  state, about 60 seconds. There have been  [propositions to turn this into a tunable value](http://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/244411 "[RFC PATCH net-next] tcp: introduce tcp_tw_interval to specifiy the time of TIME-WAIT")  but it has been refused on the ground the  `TIME-WAIT`  state is a good thing.

2. TCP 需要的资源

> Most implementations allocate an entry in a table that maps a session to a running operating system process. Because TCP packets do not include a session identifier, both endpoints identify the session using the client's address and port. Whenever a packet is received, the TCP implementation must perform a lookup on this table to find the destination process. Each entry in the table is known as a Transmission Control Block or TCB. It contains information about the endpoints (IP and port), status of the connection, running data about the packets that are being exchanged and buffers for sending and receiving data.

意思是 TCP packets 知道目标ip和端口, 但是不知道对应哪个进程, 需要在目标机器的一个map 表里面查询
> The number of sessions in the server side is limited only by memory and can grow as new connections arrive, but the client must allocate a random port before sending the first SYN to the server. This port remains allocated during the whole conversation, and effectively limits the number of outgoing connections from each of the client's IP addresses. If an application fails to properly close unrequired connections, a client can run out of resources and become unable to establish new TCP connections, even from other applications.
